This will be done on movie reviews, using the [IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n","\n","In this first notebook, we'll start very simple to understand the general concepts whilst not really caring about good results. Further notebooks will build on this knowledge and we'll actually get good results.\n","\n","### Introduction\n","\n","We'll be using a **recurrent neural network** (RNN) as they are commonly used in analysing sequences. An RNN takes in sequence of words, $X=\\{x_1, ..., x_T\\}$, one at a time, and produces a _hidden state_, $h$, for each word. We use the RNN _recurrently_ by feeding in the current word $x_t$ as well as the hidden state from the previous word, $h_{t-1}$, to produce the next hidden state, $h_t$.\n","\n","$$h_t = \\text{RNN}(x_t, h_{t-1})$$\n","\n","Once we have our final hidden state, $h_T$, (from feeding in the last word in the sequence, $x_T$) we feed it through a linear layer, $f$, (also known as a fully connected layer), to receive our predicted sentiment, $\\hat{y} = f(h_T)$.\n","\n","Below shows an example sentence, with the RNN predicting zero, which indicates a negative sentiment. The RNN is shown in orange and the linear layer shown in silver. Note that we use the same RNN for every word, i.e. it has the same parameters. The initial hidden state, $h_0$, is a tensor initialized to all zeros.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/assets/sentiment1.png?raw=1)\n","\n","**Note:** some layers and steps have been omitted from the diagram, but these will be explained later."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"q7PlOzNmH1tP"},"source":["## Preparing Data\n","\n","One of the main concepts of TorchText is the `Field`. These define how your data should be processed. In our sentiment classification task the data consists of both the raw string of the review and the sentiment, either \"pos\" or \"neg\".\n","\n","The parameters of a `Field` specify how the data should be processed.\n","\n","We use the `TEXT` field to define how the review should be processed, and the `LABEL` field to process the sentiment.\n","\n","Our `TEXT` field has `tokenize='spacy'` as an argument. This defines that the \"tokenization\" (the act of splitting the string into discrete \"tokens\") should be done using the [spaCy](https://spacy.io) tokenizer. If no `tokenize` argument is passed, the default is simply splitting the string on spaces. We also need to specify a `tokenizer_language` which tells torchtext which spaCy model to use. We use the `en_core_web_sm` model which has to be downloaded with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` before you run this notebook!\n","\n","`LABEL` is defined by a `LabelField`, a special subset of the `Field` class specifically used for handling labels.

This embedding layer is simply a single fully connected layer. As well as reducing the dimensionality of the input to the RNN, there is the theory that words which have similar impact on the sentiment of the review are mapped close together in this dense vector space. For more information about word embeddings, see [here](https://monkeylearn.com/blog/word-embeddings-transform-text-numbers/).\n","\n","The RNN layer is our RNN which takes in our dense vector and the previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$, which it uses to calculate the next hidden state, $h_t$.\n","\n","![](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-sentiment-analysis/blob/master/assets/sentiment7.png?raw=1)\n","\n","Finally, the linear layer takes the final hidden state and feeds it through a fully connected layer, $f(h_T)$, transforming it to the correct output dimension.\n","\n","The `forward` method is called when we feed examples into our model.\n","\n","Each batch, `text`, is a tensor of size _**[sentence length, batch size]**_. That is a batch of sentences, each having each word converted into a one-hot vector.\n","\n","You may notice that this tensor should have another dimension due to the one-hot vectors, however PyTorch conveniently stores a one-hot vector as it's index value, i.e. the tensor representing a sentence is just a tensor of the indexes for each token in that sentence. The act of converting a list of tokens into a list of indexes is commonly called *numericalizing*.\n","\n","The input batch is then passed through the embedding layer to get `embedded`, which gives us a dense vector representation of our sentences. `embedded` is a tensor of size _**[sentence length, batch size, embedding dim]**_.\n","\n","`embedded` is then fed into the RNN. In some frameworks you must feed the initial hidden state, $h_0$, into the RNN, however in PyTorch, if no initial hidden state is passed as an argument it defaults to a tensor of all zeros.\n","\n","The RNN returns 2 tensors, `output` of size _**[sentence length, batch size, hidden dim]**_ and `hidden` of size _**[1, batch size, hidden dim]**_. `output` is the concatenation of the hidden state from every time step, whereas `hidden` is simply the final hidden state. We verify this using the `assert` statement. Note the `squeeze` method, which is used to remove a dimension of size 1.\n","\n","Finally, we feed the last hidden state, `hidden`, through the linear layer, `fc`, to produce a prediction."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"metadata":{"id":"Q5IWVRASH1tT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1709100798317,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"Riemer van der Vliet","userId":"10043024045473808421"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import torch.nn as nn\n","\n","class RNN(nn.Module):\n","    def __init__(self, input_dim, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):\n","\n","        super().__init__()\n","\n","        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(input_dim, embedding_dim)\n","\n","        self.rnn = nn.RNN(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)\n","\n","        self.fc = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)\n","\n","    def forward(self, text, text_lengths):\n","        #text = [sent len, batch size]\n","\n","        embedded = self.embedding(text)\n","        #embedded = [sent len, batch size, emb dim]\n","\n","        output, hidden = self.rnn(embedded)\n","        #output = [sent len, batch size, hid dim]\n","        #hidden = [1, batch size, hid dim]\n","\n","        #assert torch.equal(output[-1,:,:], hidden.squeeze(0))\n","\n","        return self.fc(hidden.squeeze(0))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Grztahq0H1tT"},"source":["We now create an instance of our RNN class.\n","\n","The input dimension is the dimension of the one-hot vectors, which is equal to the vocabulary size.\n","\n","The embedding dimension is the size of the dense word vectors.
